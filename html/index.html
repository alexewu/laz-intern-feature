                "Create a way for teachers to generate and print QR codes for students to login with."

                During my internship at Learning A-Z, I was given the task of creating a new method of logging in for students using Raz-Kids. 
                Previously, they only had the option of entering a text password or clicking on an icon as a password, but with this feature they can also scan QR codes. 
                QR codes can make logging in easier for kids who don't know how to type, and also make logging in faster. 
                All they need to do is hold the QR code up to the camera. The project here is an isolation of my feature from the LAZ codebase, 
                and only encompasses the main idea of the feature: logging in. Much of this code is unused in the demo site, but is used in the actual feature.
